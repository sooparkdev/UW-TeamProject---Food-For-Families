## Problem
### Mission Statement
Centralizing localized food data to combat food insecurity.
### Problem Statement
According to HealthyPeople.gov, food insecurity is defined as “the disruption of food intake or eating patterns because of lack of money and other resources.” The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, estimates that 650 million people were quoted to be going hungry, with an even larger number of 2 billion people estimated to be facing food insecurity. The USDA Economic Research Service also claims that of these numbers, 38.3 million people lived in food insecure families, and from that, about 6.1 million children were living in a family with food insecurity. Our solution aims at targeting these demographics and reducing the amounts of families and children facing hunger.

Children who face food insecurity are more likely to perform poorly in school compared to their peers. Without proper nutrition, children are at greater risk of increased hospitalizations, developmental risk and behavior problems, and anxiety to name a few. According to “FeedingAmerica,” roughly 13 million children experienced food insecurity in 2021. Additionally, with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, families and children who were facing food insecurity already are facing even greater hardships with limited capacity at food pantries as an example.

Existing solutions, such as Feeding America–while providing location-centered information–tend to concentrate data exclusively around food banks. Consequently, this can end up missing mutual aid work and pop-up food pantries that can provide relief to families facing food insecurity (“Find Your Local Food Bank.”). On a more local scale, groups like Seattle Food Committee, however, provide more detailed information on food resources, yet they lack map-based and location-based features that would allow for a smoother user experience; oftentimes, smaller companies do not have the resources to do this (Seattle Food Committee). Taken together, larger solutions tend to not be specific enough to the area and culture while smaller solutions struggle to scale their data in a way that is meaningful.

(H2) Solution Summary
Food For Friends aims to combine aspects of location-based information with expansive knowledge of food resources (including mutual aid groups, food banks, community fridges, etc.) to combat food insecurity. We allow users to quickly and efficiently find food resources near them, with a focus on eliminating family and child food insecurity.
## Design
### Home Page
The home page consists of a 
Navigation bar
Body
Footer

In the navigation bar, our website/team name is adjusted at the center, with four buttons as well: Home page, Food Near You page, Submission Form page, and Settings which I will explain more in detail below. These buttons are on all the other pages as well so that it is more convenient for the users to switch between tabs. 
In the body of the Home page, users can either go to the Food Near You, Favorites, or Submission Form page. 
In the footer, information about our organization is presented to the users.



### Food Near You
The Food Near You page is where the user would simply search the elementary school nearest to them in the search bar. We chose to do this because many families with young children tend to struggle with food insecurity. Thus, if we show results near their elementary school, it could be convenient for the family. The page will then present them with the nearest food pantries near that school. With each location, the name of the organization will show, along with the distance from the user's current location, and an option to favorite. When favorited, the favorite icon will turn yellow. 
Our stretch goal is to make food pantries available from any location and not just limited to elementary schools. Another stretch goal we have is to integrate a map feature that allows users to visually see where food resources are located geographically. 



If the inputted location is not an elementary school in Seattle, an error message will pop up letting the user know. 

### Submission Form
Because we recognize that food resources can change and develop, we have integrated a submission form to make our solution more community-based. The Submission Form page allows users to recommend a food pantry, notify others that they are hosting a pop-up, etc. The sections consist of: 
Users name
Users phone number
Users email
Organizations name
Organizations phone number 
Organizations email
Food source that has food bank, food pantry, and community fridge as options
Location of the food pantry
Description (recommendation, hosting pop-up, fast service, delivery service, etc.)


If a part of the submission form isn’t filled out, an error message is displayed. Only once that part is filled will the user be able to submit their form. This is so that other users can reach out to the person or organization if they have any questions or concerns. 


### Favorites
The favorites page will list the users favorite food pantries. There is a dropdown menu that gives the user options to sort it by either distance or most recently favorited. 

### Settings
On our settings page, users input their email, phone number, distance preference, food source preference, and language preference. Creating an account and distance preference are optional, but food source preference and language preference are required. 
Distance preference can range from 0 to 15 miles. 
Food source preference has food banks, food pantries, and community fridges as the options. 
Language preference has English as the default language, and ___________.
