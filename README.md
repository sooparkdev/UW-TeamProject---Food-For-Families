## Problem Statement
Food insecurity is a global issue, currently further exasperated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The USDA defines food insecurity as households not having enough access to food to meet their household's needs. Even within the U.S., considered one of the wealthiest nations in the world, a rising number of Americans experience food insecurities further harmed by loss of job opportunities, lack of access to proper healthcare, and a lack of centralized information in the midst of a global pandemic. According to an NPR article Food Insecurity in the U.S. by the Numbers", a quarter of households in the U.S. are experiencing food insecurity (Christanna Silva, 2020). The most common solution for food insecurity has been through food pantries and food banks. However, as outlined in the AP News article, "US food banks struggle to feed hungry amid surging prices", it has been difficult for existing food banks and pantries to keep up with the rising demand due to staffing and food shortages caused by COVID-19 surges (Janie Har, 2021).
